# PerMapConVarEnforcer
This plugin is an extension to the original ConVar Enforcer plugin which adds per map support where you can enforce commands based on the map

## Installation
-To install this plugin you must install the original ConVar Enforcer plugin from the link below because this plugin uses natives from that plugin (since it's an extention)
